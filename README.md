#### Insights
The dataset collects details on dishes for sale, orders placed, customer details, and membership joining date. 

Customer B bought everything on the menu <b>twice</b>, having visited 6 times, and every customer purchased at least 2 bowls of ramen each. Ramen üçú was by far the most popular dish, with double the sales of the closest competing item, curry üçõ. The least popular was sushi.

Customer C never became a member. However, A and B did and respectively each bought curry and sushi first after becoming a member. Sushi was also customer B's favourite dish.

<b>A:</b> Pizza Metrics
1. How many pizzas were ordered?
2. How many unique customer orders were made?

4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?

10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?

üÖ±Ô∏è: Runner and Customer Experience

2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

#### Entities

The most common time to order was the late evening, with 6 orders occurring at 9 and 11 pm. The most popular day to order was Friday.
